    <title>Form validation</title>

    Methods of validation:

    HTML validation:
    - required attribute makes innput to be mandatory filled,
    - minlegth (doesnt imply required) is min length of characters,
    - maxlength (doesnt imply required) is max length of characters,
    - min is minimum value regulator,
    - max is maximum value regulator
    - pattern is used to control validaion by RegExp value (only available for input)

    CSS validaion:

    - :valid and :invalid when input data correct (:valid) and wrong (:invalid)

    Client-side validation is a nicety which can prevent common data-entry errors before an app
    wastes time and bandwidth sending data to a server. It’s not a substitute for server-side
    validation!

    Always sanitize data server-side. Not every request will come from a browser. Even when it does,
    there’s no guarantee the browser validated the data. Anyone who knows how to open a browser’s
    developer tools can also bypass your lovingly crafted HTML and JavaScript.
