<body>

    Most used browser now is Google Chrome.

    First ever browser is WorldWideWeb which later renamed to Nexus.

    Apple doesnt really let you to use all functionality of lets say Firefox or Chrome, it just allows
    you make it as "used to have" mask and all renderig and operation going through safari anyway. 
    Also apple requires that all web apps were compatible with WebKit.
