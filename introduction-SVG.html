        SVG - scallable vector graphics, defined by math. With vector graphics (and absence of
        grid) we use formulas to scale file to any size or shape we want.

        SVG defined using XML (Extensible Markup Language) is HTML-like syntax which is used for
        things like APIs, RSSs, spreadsheets and word editor software.

        Benefits of SVG being XML are: 
        1. Human readable, nt like JPEG's binary file format (still confusing tho),
        2. Its interoperatable with HTML, without any changes or specifications. Because of that 
        they can be targeted in the DOM like HTML elements.

        Main disadvantage of SVG comes from high resolution, high detailed picture. SVG bad for that.

        Main parts of SVG:
        1. xmlns - stands for "XML NameSpace" is dialect of XML,
        2. viewBox - defines bounds of SVG file,
        3. class, id - used same way to target elements,
        4. <circle>, <rect>, <path>, <text> are defined by namespace (basic building blocks),
        
        Embedding :
        - Inline pasting SVG into webpage code (cleaner, simpler and opens full potential)
        - Linking via HTML <img> or CSS background-image: url()
