    // Child and sibling selectors:
    > - the child combinator (helps us to select only direct children, one indentation down)

    <style>
        main>div {
            /* targeting "child" class div only */
            color: black;
        }

        main>div>div {
            /*  targeting "grand-child" class div only */
            color: black;
        }
    </style>

    + - the adjacent combinator (helps us target elements immediately following or on the same level of indentation)

    <style>
        .group1+div {
            /* targeting "child group2" class div only */
            color: black;
        }

        .group1+div+div {
            /*  targeting "child group3" class div only */
            color: black;
        }
    </style>

    ~ - the general sibling combinator (helps to target all of the siblings following an element)

    <style>
        .group~div {
            /* in the case above it will target "2nd and 3rd childe divs" */

            color: black;

        }
    </style>


    // Pseudo-selectors are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

    // Pseudo-classes (0,0,1,0) offer us a different way to target elements in HTML.


    // dynamic and user action pseudo classes - they make page feel much more dynamic and interactive:

    :focus - applies to element selected by the user. basically it applies effect when user navigates or clicks on
    element (e.g .lime-input:focus {color: lime;} , which will paint text to lime color when we click on this element)
    :hover - affects anything under the user's cursor.
    :active - applies to element that currently being clicked, creates 'tactile' feedback.
    :link and :visited - change when link was/or wasnt yet used by user.


    // structural pseudo-classes - useful way to select elements based on their position within DOM.

    :root is a special class representing very top of document and has o parents. its a place for 'global CSS'.
    :first-child and :last-child will match elements that are first or last sibling.
    :empty - match element with no children.
    :only-child - match elements with no siblings.
    :nth-child - flexible class for dynamic approach, with few different uses:

    <style>
        .myList:nth-child(5) {
            /* Selects the 5th element with class myList */
            color: black;
        }

        .myList:nth-child(3n) {
            /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList */
            color: black;
        }

        .myList:nth-child(3n + 3) {
            /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList, beginning with the 3rd */
            color: black;
        }

        .myList:nth-child(even) {
            /* Selects every even element with class myList */
            color: black;
        }
    </style>



    // Pseudo-elements (0,0,0,1) - allows to affect part of HTML which ae not elements.

        ::marker - allows to customize bullets or numbers in <li>
        ::first-letter and ::first line allowa to style first letter or line of some text
        ::selection allows to change the highlighting when user selects text on a page
        ::before and ::after allow to add extra elements on the page with CSS. Using to decorate text is main use.


    // Attribute selectors (0,0,1,0) - allows to target attributes, such as src="", type ="", etc..

        [attribute] - general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists.
        selector[attribute] - the way to combine attiribute selector and other types of selectors
        [attribute="value"] - allows to track specific attribute.

        <style>
            [src] {
                /* This will target any element that has a src attribute. */
                color: black;
            }

            img[src] {
                /* This will only target img elements that have a src attribute. */
                color: black;
            }

            img[src="puppy.jpg"] {
                /* This will target img elements with a src attribute that is exactly "puppy.jpg" */
                color: black;
            }
        </style>

        to be even more precise we can use:

    [attribute^="value"] - ^= match strings from the start.
    [attribute$="value"] - $= match strings from the end.
    [attribute*="value"] - *= The wildcard selector will match anywhere inside the string.


        <style>
            [class^='aus'] {
            /* Classes are attributes too!
            This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
            class='austria'
            class='australia'
          */
          color: black;
        }
        
            [src$='.jpg'] {
            /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
            src='puppy.jpg'
            src='kitten.jpg'
          */
          color: black;
        }
        
            [for*='ill'] {
            /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
            for="bill"
            for="jill"
            for="silly"
            for="ill"
          */
          color: black;
        }
        </style>
