<body>
    There are absolute and relative units in CSS.
    Absolute are the ones that always the same. For web its 'px'.

    Relative are the ones that can be changed based on their context:
    1. em/rem (rem prefferable). 1em = 16px
    2. viewport units.
    1 vh = 1% - viewport width
    1 vh = 1% - viewport height
    1 vmin = 1% - a percentage of vw or vh, whichever is smaller.
    1 vmax = 1% - a percentage of vw or vh, whichever is higher.
    same as em/rem/px these viewport units can be used in multiple places.

    there is a good use in responsive typography - combine viewport values and px, to reduce too
    drastic change of things by only using viewport values, its handled by calc(), as example
    calc(16px + 1 vw).


    Piece of advice is to use rem (root) for font-size and the rest px, but em/rem usage is possible.

  
    Text scaling & accessibility - `rem` 
    Component-relative sizing - `em` 
    Full-screen / viewport layouts - `vh` / `vw`
    Pixel-perfect details and exact visual control - `px`

    hero image/layout - is a huge image/part of layout containing image/banner used as design 
    method to style webpage, it creates glimpse of what your business offers 9some sort of trick to 
    emphasize on service or product.
