    // Default positionng mode is position: static. 
    // Static position doesnt behave in any way on top,
    right, bottom, left; at the other hand relative behaves as a static, but top,right, left, bottom 
    displace the element relative to its normal position in the flow of document. 

    // Absolute positioning
    // position: absolute allows you to position something at exact point without disturbing other 
    elements around it. Using TLBR directions element can be placed anywhere on the screen.
    Extremely useful for positioning something at the exact point on the screen, without disturbing 
    any of other elements. 
    IRL cases:
    -modals,
    -image with a caption on it,
    -icons on. top of other elements,
    WARNING: absolute should not be used for every occasion and ha some limited specific cases,
    flexbox and grid should be prioritized. 

    // Fixed positioning
    // Fixed elements removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to viewport. Using TLBR 
    to position, and it will stay there, as the user scrolls. 
    IRL cases:
    -nav. bars 
    -floating chat buttons

    // Sticky positioning
    // Act like nrmal elements until scrolled, after scrolled they turn into fixed elements. They 
    are not taken out of normal flow of the document. IRL case:
    -section-heading
