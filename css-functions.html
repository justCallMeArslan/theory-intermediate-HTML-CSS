    // CSS functions are reusable pieces of code which perform specific tasks.
    // calc() allows to mix units and has abiliy to nest calc (calc() - calc())


    // min() takes a list of values separated by commas and returns the smallest one, also
    allows us to do basic math, without using calc():

    width: min(80ch, 100vw - 2rem),

    where first elememt is basic default value, which checks against second vslue, if second value 
    less than first it will take it for default size, if second value more than first - value of 
    first will be used as default.


    // max() compares all values and returns the largest one. 

    width:max(100px, 4em, 50%) - largest will be used as default. Great tool for accessibility.


    // clamp() is a great way to make elements fluid and responsive. It takes 3 values:

    h1 {
        font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem);
    }
    
    first - minimum value is 1.5rem,
    second - scaling value 5vw,
    third - maximum value 3rem
