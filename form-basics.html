    // The form element

    Its a container element like the div element we learned earlier in the curriculum, the form
    element wraps all of the inputs the user will interact with on form.

    the form takes two attributes: action and method
    - action is attribute which takes a URL value that tells the form where it should send its data
    to be processed.
    - method is attribute which tells browser what HTTP protocol request method it should use to
    submit the form (GET and POST used the most).
    GET method used to retrieve information from a server (e.g Google search query);
    POST is used when we want to chage something on the server, e.g. when a user makes an account or
    makes a payment on a website.

    Basic markup is:
    <form action="google.com/path" method="post"></form>


    // The input element

    Its the most versatile of all the form control elements. It accepts type attriibute which tells
    the browser what type of data it should expect and how it should render the input element.

    A text input looks like:

    <form action="google.com/path" method="post">
        <input type="text"> //used to collect any text data, such user login and password.
    </form>

    // label attribute

    used to provide user with a guidance on waht information it shoud provide in input window

    <form action="google.com/path" method="post">
        <label for="first_name">First name:</label> //expected text is first name of user
        <input type="text" id="first_name">
    </form>

    <label> </label> for="" attribute which associates with particular input, requiring id=""
    attribute with the same value as for"". this manipulation will make a form more accessible to
    user as it will focus cursor on the input, ready for input data.

    // name attribute

    name = "" is used to provide server with information on what piece of data we send to it.

    <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name">

    name = "" attribute serves as reference to the data inputted into a form control after submit.
    if there is no name ="" in form input, it will be ignored when form is submitted.

        <div>
            <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="last_name">Last Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="age">Age:</label>
            <input type="number" name="age" id="age">
        </div>

        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    // type attribute

    email inputs are specialized text inputs for email addresses.

    password inputs are also specialized. they hide input with * to prevent seeing of what was entered.

    number inputs only accept number values and ignores any other type of characters.

    date inputs provide with option to collect specific date.

    <label for="dob">Date of Birth:</label>
    <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob">
