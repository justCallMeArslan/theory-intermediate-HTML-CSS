    Fonts can be:
    1. system font stack - system based vanilla fonts
    2. web fonts - fonts which downloaded on home machine from web
    3. online font libraries - google fonts, font library and etc
    4. self-hosted fonts - downloaded and available on machine, using @font-face

    @font-face {
    font-family: my-cool-font;
    src: url(../fonts/the-font-file.woff);
    }

    Text styles

    1. font-style is used to make text italic/bold/etc. - CSS property to highlight text, however
    em, strong - used to do the same as font-style , but they have additional purpose to emphasize
    text.
    2 . letter-spacing is used to change the space between leters in a word. Can be used to adjust
    fonts as well.
    3. line-height is usedto adjust space betwee lines in wrapped text. Good to increase readability.
    4. text-transform is used to change the case of given text (Upper or Lower or mixed)
    5. text-shadow is used to add shadow arouhnd the text in the selected element.
    6. elipsis - not a single property, but group of. With text-overflow it is possible to truncate
    overflowing text with an elipsis.

    Font loading - how fast fonts loaded for webpage (Dev Tools -> Network -> Timing)


    @font-face {
    font-family: "Open Sans";
    src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
    unicode-range: U+0025-00FF; // - can limit number of characters downloaded for specified font,
    in other words it will only download used on webpage characters of specified font
    }


    font-display - used to inform browser how it should proceed with text rendering, helping 
    transition to a custom font, values are:

    Value     Block period       Swap period
    Auto      Varies by browser  Varies by browser
    Block     2-3 seconds        Infinite
    Swap      0ms                Infinite
    Fallback  100ms              3 seconds
    Optional  100ms              None

    They have different purposes and different usage:

    for performance - font-display: optional,
    for quickly display  - font-display: swap,
    for text displayed in a web font - font-display: block.

    these two approaches can be combined: for example, use font-display: swap for branding and 
    other visually distinctive page elements. Use font-display: optional for fonts used in body text.

    line-length can be set by 
    article {
    max-inline-size: 66ch;
    }

    clamp() function - allows locking the font size between sensible minimums and maximums while also 
    providing a scalable middle value. Exactly, prevent too small or too large text, while also 
    providing a smooth scaling font size.

    html {  
    font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.75rem + 1.5vw, 2rem); // example
    }
</body>
